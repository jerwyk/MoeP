TODO:
1. have a working process manager
2. have a basic file system for at least stdio
3. a way to send a and recieve messages


rework of interrupt handling:
instead of manually handling all request,
create a kernel call recieve() to recieve interrupt messages
when a interrupt handler gets an interrupt, it send a messages to the device driver

or...
we can just keep all drivers in kernel space lol

process:
Process scheduler: maintains a process table with one entry per process
    The entry contains state, program counter, stack pointer, memory alloc, open files, accounting and scheduling, alarms, etc
